## Bash profile

My favourite shortcuts that I'd be lost without, and would leave me scratching my had asking "how do I run that IRL?"

`.bash_profile` being the obvious root, it will link to a `.bash_profile_local` for speicifc local path envs and such (sample provided) as well as `.bash_profile_work` for the sensitive stuff I probably shouldn't leak.
